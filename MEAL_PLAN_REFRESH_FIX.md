# Meal Plan Refresh Fix Summary

## Issue
The "Today's Personalized Meal Plan" on the homepage was not updating properly after users logged food. The meal plan would become stale and not reflect the current day's consumption.

## Root Cause
1. **No automatic refresh**: The homepage only refreshed meal plan data when using the quick log dialog, not when logging food through other means (chat, image upload, etc.)
2. **Complex AI logic**: The meal plan regeneration logic was overly complex and failing silently
3. **Missing notifications**: Users weren't notified when meal plan updates failed or succeeded
4. **Format inconsistencies**: Meal plan data formats were inconsistent between backend and frontend

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Global Food Logging Event System
- Added `foodLoggedTrigger` to AppContext to notify components when food is logged
- Updated HomePage to listen for food logging events and refresh data automatically
- Updated Chat and ChatWidget components to trigger the event after food logging

### 2. Simplified Meal Plan Regeneration
- Replaced complex AI-generated meal plan logic with simple, reliable meal suggestions
- Based suggestions on remaining calories (high/medium/low calorie ranges)
- Removed dependency on OpenAI API calls for meal plan updates
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 3. Added User Notifications
- Added notification when meal plan is updated successfully
- Shows remaining calories in the notification
- Provides clear feedback to users about meal plan status

### 4. Fixed Data Format Consistency
- Ensured meal plan format matches frontend expectations
- Fixed "snack" vs "snacks" field naming consistency
- Proper validation in save_meal_plan function

## Key Code Changes

### AppContext.tsx
- Added `foodLoggedTrigger` state and `triggerFoodLogged` function
- Global event system for food logging notifications

### HomePage.tsx
- Added `useEffect` to listen for food logging events
- Automatic data refresh when food is logged
- Added meal plan update notifications

### Chat.tsx & ChatWidget.tsx
- Added `triggerFoodLogged()` calls after successful food logging
- Integrated with global event system

### main.py (Backend)
- Simplified meal plan regeneration logic in `quick_log_food`
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Returns meal plan update status in API response

## Testing The Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. **Log food via quick log dialog**: Should update meal plan and show notification
2. **Log food via chat interface**: Should trigger homepage refresh automatically
3. **Log food via image upload**: Should update meal plan and refresh homepage
4. **Check meal plan content**: Should show updated suggestions based on remaining calories

## Expected Behavior

1. User logs food → Food logging event triggered
2. Backend creates updated meal plan with remaining calories
3. Frontend automatically refreshes homepage data
4. User sees notification about meal plan update
5. Today's Personalized Meal Plan shows updated content

## Impact

- ✅ Homepage meal plan now updates automatically after food logging
- ✅ Users receive clear feedback about meal plan updates
- ✅ Simplified, more reliable meal plan generation
- ✅ Consistent data format between backend and frontend
- ✅ Better error handling and logging for debugging
